## Business Constraints / Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)

However, setting the optimal price for cars to maximize sales and demand is a challenging aspect of car sales. Factors such as __mileage__, __car size__, __manufacturer__, and various others influence car prices. Yet, for humans to accurately determine prices comprehensively, especially given the multitude of influencing features, is difficult. One potential solution to this challenge lies in leveraging __machine learning__ and __data science__ to gain insights and make informed predictions, thereby driving profitability for companies.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning

* Machine Learning and deep learning have gained significant popularity in the past decade.
* It would be highly beneficial to predict car prices based on features such as horsepower, make, and others.
* Consider a scenario where a company aims to determine car prices using features like make, horsepower, and mileage.
* This can be achieved using machine learning models, enabling the company to accurately set prices that maximize profitability.
* Thus, employing machine learning models ensures optimal pricing for new cars, leading to cost savings for manufacturers.
* Our focus will involve analyzing car price prediction data and forecasting prices for various types of cars.
* Initial steps include visualizing the data and gaining crucial insights necessary for accurate predictions.
* Different regression techniques will be utilized to estimate the average price of the car in question.

<h2> Data Source</h2>

* We would be working with quite a large data which contains about __10000__ data points where again we would be dividing that into the training set and the test set.
* Having a look at some of the cars that we are always excited to use in our daily lives, it is better to understand how these cars are being sold and their average prices. 
* Feel free to take a look at the dataset that was used in the process of predicting the prices of cars. Below is the link.
